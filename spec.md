## Project Idea:

### Description:  
Create a personal, local, text-based fantasy adventure game using a local large language model (LLM). The MVP uses a premade, fully built-out fantasy world for players to explore, focusing on character creation, interaction, and persistent gameplay within this fixed setting.

### Objectives:  
- Develop a minimal viable product (MVP) that runs offline on personal hardware.  
- Enable players to create characters and interact meaningfully within a premade fantasy world.  
- Implement persistence of player stats, NPC memories, and world state.  
- Lay foundation for future expansions, including world creation tools and multiplayer.

### Added Value:  
Provides an immersive, offline AI-driven text RPG experience with persistent world memory and personalized storytelling, appealing to fans of tabletop RPGs and narrative games.

## Feasibility Study:

### Market Analysis:  
Growing interest in AI-driven games and solo RPG tools; niche but expanding market for offline text adventures enhanced by LLMs.

### Technical Analysis:  
Leverages local LLM inference with quantized models; uses SQLite and vector DBs for persistent memory; requires efficient context management.

### Financial Analysis:  
Main investment is developer time; minimal direct costs using open-source tools and existing hardware.

### Stakeholder Analysis (Simplified)  
Primarily a solo project with potential to grow into community-driven or commercial product.

## Stakeholder Identification:

- Primary: Developer/User (you)  
- Future: Players, Modders, Content Creators

### Roles and Interests:  
- Developer: Build and test MVP, iteratively improve.  
- Players: Immersive and consistent narrative experience.  
- Modders/Devs: Expand features and genres.

## Stakeholder Needs:

### Identified Needs:  
- Functional MVP running locally with premade world.  
- Persistent and believable world and NPC memories.  
- Organic character progression.  
- Expandable architecture.

### Information Collection Methods:  
- Self-testing and debugging.  
- Future user feedback, surveys, playtests.

### Communication Plan:  
- Internal dev notes initially.  
- Future dev blogs, forums, community channels.

# Requirements Gathering (With Examples)

## User Stories / Use Cases:

### Player Role  
- As a player, I want to create a character with name, stats, and proficiencies.  
- As a player, I want to interact with the premade world and NPCs through natural language.  
- As a player, I want my stats to evolve organically based on actions.  
- As a player, I want NPCs to remember past interactions.  
- As a player, I want to save and resume my sessions.

## Detailed Use Cases:

**Use Case 1 — Load Premade World**  
Actors: System  
Preconditions: Game launched  
Flow: Load premade world data from file or database

**Use Case 2 — Create Character**  
Actors: Player  
Preconditions: World loaded  
Flow: Enter character info → assign proficiencies → save character

**Use Case 3 — Play Session**  
Actors: Player  
Preconditions: World & character loaded  
Flow: Narrator scene → player input → LLM response → update stats/NPCs → save progress

**Use Case 4 — NPC Interaction & Memory**  
Actors: Player, NPC  
Flow: Player interacts → NPC responds based on memory → update relationships
